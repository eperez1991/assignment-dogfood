For fall semester 2014, I intend to follow the developer maxim of *Eat your own dogfood* by completing projects that I have assigned students in my classes.

Iâ€™m teaching two sections of my Standards-Based Web Design course; the projects are almost the same in both and can be viewed at http://ks4.us/327 (undergrad) and http://ks4.us/530 (grad).

The `master` branch always contains the most current project; projects will eventually be on orphaned branches at their completion.
